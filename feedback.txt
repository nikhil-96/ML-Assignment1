Feedback for Patni, N.:

Q1.1 (code): 1.0/1
Good

Q1.2 (plot): 1.0/1
Good

Q1.3 (MC, auto): 0.5/1
The model is underfitting at c=1e-6.

Q2.1 (plots): 2.0/2
Good. But be careful that you should remove % from your accuracy in the title. 

Q2.2 (open): 0.25/1
Not very accurate. The model at c=1e-6 underfits and the coefficient plot catches the most common and simple tsu shape while at c=10 shows very noisy plot.

Q3.1 (plots): 2.0/2
Well done 

Q3.2 (open): 0.5/1
You miss the reason why those simple shapes can be predicted correctly while complex ones cannot. The model is underfitting at c=1e-6.
